# Depth-First Search (DFS) on Graph

## Purpose
This project implements Depth-First Search (DFS) on a graph using an adjacency matrix and a stack. The algorithm explores nodes deeply before backtracking, starting from vertex 0.

## How It Works
- The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.
- A stack is used to track the traversal path.
- Each vertex is marked as visited when explored.
- The algorithm continues until all reachable vertices are visited.

## Key Features
- Iterative stack-based traversal.
- Displays each visited vertex.
- Avoids revisiting nodes using a visited flag.

## Benefits
- Efficient for exploring connected components.
- Useful in pathfinding, cycle detection, and graph analysis.
- Simple to implement and extend.

## What I Learned
This implementation helped me understand how DFS works using a stack and adjacency matrix. I learned how to manage visited states and how traversal order affects the result. It also clarified the difference between depth-first and breadth-first strategies.
