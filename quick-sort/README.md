# Quick Sort in C++

This project implements the Quick Sort algorithm using C++.  
I built it during my first year of Software Engineering studies to understand recursive sorting techniques.

## 🎯 Purpose

To learn how divide-and-conquer algorithms work and how recursion can be used to sort efficiently.

## 🔧 Features

- Input array size and elements
- Display array before and after sorting
- Sort using Quick Sort logic

## 📁 Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- IDE: Code::Blocks or any C++ compiler

## 📌 Sample Output

Enter array size: 5 Enter array elements: 9 3 5 1 7 Array before sort: 9 3 5 1 7 Array after sort: 1 3 5 7 9
