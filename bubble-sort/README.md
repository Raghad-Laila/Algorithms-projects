# Bubble Sort in C++

📚 This project implements the Bubble Sort algorithm using C++ and allows the user to input and sort an array interactively.
it was developed during my first year of Software Engineering studies as part of the Algorithms course.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to understand how basic sorting algorithms work and how nested loops can be used to compare and swap elements.  
This helped me strengthen my understanding of control structures and algorithmic thinking.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How Bubble Sort works step by step
- How to use nested loops effectively
- How to handle user input and display results clearly

## 🤝 How It Helped Me Later

Understanding Bubble Sort allowed me to:

- Compare its performance with other sorting algorithms like Insertion and Quick Sort
- Build visual tools to demonstrate sorting steps
- Use sorting logic in real-world applications like ranking and filtering

## 🔧 Features

- Accepts user input for array size and elements
- Displays the array before and after sorting
- Sorts the array using the Bubble Sort technique

## 📁 Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Code::Blocks)

## 📌 Sample Input

enter the size
5
enter the array
9 3 5 1 7

## 📌 Sample Output

ther array befor sort
9
3
5
1
7
ther array after sort
1
3
5
7
9
