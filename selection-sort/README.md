# Selection Sort in C++

This is a simple implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm using C++.  
I built this project during my first year of Software Engineering studies as part of the Algorithms course.

## 🎯 Purpose

To understand how sorting algorithms work and practice using loops and comparisons.  
This was one of my first hands-on coding exercises, and it helped me build confidence in writing clean logic.

## 🔧 Features

- Input array size and elements
- Display array before and after sorting
- Sort using Selection Sort technique

## 📁 Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- IDE: Code::Blocks

## 📌 Sample Output

Enter Array's size
5
Enter Array's Elements
9 3 5 1 7
Your Array before sort =
9 3 5 1 7
Your Array after sort =
1 3 5 7 9
