# Linked List in Java

This project implements a basic singly linked list using Java.  
I built it during my first year of Software Engineering studies to understand dynamic data structures.

## 🎯 Purpose

To learn how nodes are linked in memory and how to build a list without using arrays.

## 🔧 Features

- Insert elements into the list
- Traverse and print the list

## 📁 Tech Stack

- Language: Java
- IDE: NetBeans or any Java compiler

## 📌 Sample Output

Linked List: 10 → 20 → 30 → null
