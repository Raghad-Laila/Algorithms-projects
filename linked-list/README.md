# Linked List in Java

This project implements a basic singly linked list using Java.  
I built it during my first year of Software Engineering studies to understand dynamic data structures.

##  Purpose

To learn how nodes are linked in memory and how to build a list without using arrays.

##  Features

- Insert elements into the list
- Traverse and print the list

##  Tech Stack

- Language: Java
- IDE: NetBeans or any Java compiler

##  Sample Output

Linked List: 10 → 20 → 30 → null
