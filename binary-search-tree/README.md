# Binary Search Tree in Java

📚 This project implements a basic Binary Search Tree (BST) using Java and was built in the NetBeans IDE.
it was developed during my first year of Software Engineering studies as part of the Algorithms course.

## 🔧 Features

- Insert nodes into the BST
- Prevent duplicate entries
- Print tree elements using In-Order traversal
- Calculate the height of the tree

## 📁 Technologies Used

- Language: Java
- IDE: NetBeans

## 🧠 Purpose

This project was created to practice fundamental data structures and recursion.  
I'm sharing it now as part of archiving and documenting my academic work.

## 📌 Sample Usage

`java
root = BST.insert(root, 8);
root = BST.insert(root, 3);
root = BST.insert(root, 6);
root = BST.insert(root, 10);
root = BST.insert(root, 4);
root = BST.insert(root, 7);
root = BST.insert(root, 1);
root = BST.insert(root, 14);
root = BST.insert(root, 13);

## 📌 Sample Output

1
3
4
6
7
8
10
13
14

## height = 3
