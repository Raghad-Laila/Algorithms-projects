# Algorithms Projects – First Year

This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations developed during my first year of Software Engineering studies.  
Each folder represents a standalone project with its own code and documentation.

## 📦 Included Projects

- 🔁 Bubble Sort (C++)
- 📥 Insertion Sort (C++)
- 🎯 Selection Sort (C++)
- ⚡ Quick Sort (C++)
- 🌳 Binary Search Tree (Java)
- 🔗 Linked List (Java – Maven)

Each project includes:

- Sample input/output
- A brief README explaining the purpose and logic

## 🎯 Purpose

To practice core algorithmic thinking and understand how different sorting and data structure techniques work in real code.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- C++ (Code::Blocks)
- Java (NetBeans + Maven)
