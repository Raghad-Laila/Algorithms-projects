# Algorithms Projects – First Year

This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations developed during my first year of Software Engineering studies.  
Each folder represents a standalone project with its own code and documentation.

##  Included Projects

-  Bubble Sort (C++)
-  Insertion Sort (C++)
-  Selection Sort (C++)
-  Quick Sort (C++)
-  Binary Search Tree (Java)
-  Linked List (Java – Maven)
-  Balance tree (Java)
-  B plus tree (Java)
-  Graph (Java)
-  DFS (java)
-  AVL tree (java)

Each project includes:

- Source code
- Sample input/output
- A brief README explaining the purpose and logic

##  Purpose

To practice core algorithmic thinking and understand how different sorting and data structure techniques work in real code.

##  Tech Stack

- C++ (Code::Blocks)
- Java (NetBeans + Maven)
