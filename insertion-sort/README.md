# Insertion Sort in C++

📚 This project was developed during my first year of Software Engineering studies as part of the Algorithms course.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to understand how sorting algorithms work at a low level, and how they manipulate arrays step by step.  
This helped me build a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and problem solving.

## 🤝 How It Helped Me Later

Understanding sorting deeply allowed me to:

- Implement more advanced algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort
- Build visual tools to compare sorting speeds
- Use sorting logic in real-world applications like filtering and ranking

## 🔧 Features

- Accepts user input for array size and elements
- Displays the array before and after sorting
- Sorts the array using the Insertion Sort technique

## 📁 Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Code::Blocks)

## 📌 Sample Input

Enter Array's size
5
Enter Array's Elements
9 3 5 1 7

## 📌 Sample Output

Your Array before sort =
9
3
5
1
7
Your Array after sort =
1
3
5
7
9
